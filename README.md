# theshodo.com | revived
Forked Shodo calligraphy HTML5 application created by [b-architects](http://www.b-architects.com) for Microsoft; the original website is no longer available.

## Demo
An online demo is available here: https://cobysy.github.io/Shodo/.

It should work in most newer browsers.

### Keyboard shortcuts
| command | description                    |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| <kbd>esc</kbd>     | Skip intro movie    |
| <kbd>d</kbd>       | Clear               |
| <kbd>b</kbd>       | Select brush        |


## Notes
This work is based a 'saved through the browser' and broken version which is available in Williammer's repository [here](https://github.com/Williammer/Shodo).   

Some smaller changes have been made in order to bring back the application into a working condition (mostly due to not providing online storage for saving calligraphy drawn by users, and to missing files - a very few I managed to grab through web.archive.org).
